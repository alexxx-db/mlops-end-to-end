# MAGIC ### What is a webhook?
# MAGIC A webhook will call a web URL whenever a given event occurs. In our case, that's when a model is updated or deployed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC __A primary goal with MLOps is to introduce more robust testing and automation into how we deploy machine learning models.__  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To aid in this effort, the MLflow Model Registry supports webhooks that are triggered during the following events in the lifecycle of a model. This will allow us to automatically:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Perform general validation checks and tests on any model added to the Registry
# MAGIC * Send notification / slack alert when a new model is updated
# MAGIC * Introducing a new model to acccept traffic for A/B testing
# MAGIC * ...
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Note that we only have to do this once for our churn model.*

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Webhook Supported events
# MAGIC * A new model is added to the Registry
# MAGIC * A new version of a registered model is added to the Registry
# MAGIC * A model lifecycle transition request is made (e.g., from _Production_ to _Archived_)
# MAGIC * A transition request is accepted or rejected
# MAGIC * A comment is made on a model version

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Example
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the following example, we have two notebooks - the first commits the model to the Model Registry, and the second runs a series of general validation checks and tests on it. You can see the entire workflow illustrated below.

# MAGIC <br><br>
# MAGIC Let's look at how this workflow plays out chronologically:<br><br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Data Scientist finishes model training and commits best model to Registry
# MAGIC 2. Data Scientist requests lifecyle transition of best model to _Staging_
# MAGIC 3. Webhooks are set for transition request event, and trigger a Databricks Job to test the model, and a Slack message to let the organization know that the lifecycle event is occurring
# MAGIC 4. The testing job is launched
# MAGIC 5. Depending on testing results, the lifecycle transition request is accepted or rejected
# MAGIC 6. Webhooks trigger and send another Slack message to report the results of testing

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Install Databricks webhooks utility
# MAGIC %pip install databricks-registry-webhooks

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ./_resources/00-setup $reset_all_data=false $catalog="hive_metastore"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### Create Webhooks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Setting up webhooks is simple using the Databricks REST API.  There are some helper functions in the `./_resources/API_Helpers` notebook, so if you want to see additional details you can check there.  

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Model testing - Staging transition request
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A testing notebook has been created by the ML Engineer team (we'll cover that in details soon).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To accept the STAGING request, we'll run this notebook as a Databricks Job whenever we receive a request to move a model to STAGING.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The job will be in charge to validate or reject the transition upon completion.

# COMMAND ----------

#DEMO SETUP
#For this demo, the job is programatically created if it doesn't exist. See ./_resources/API_Helpers for more details
job_id = get_churn_staging_job_id()
#This should be run once. For the demo We'll reset other webhooks to prevent from duplicated call
reset_webhooks(model_name = "dbdemos_mlops_churn")

#Once we have the id of the job running the tests, we add the hook:
create_job_webhook(model_name = "dbdemos_mlops_churn", job_id = job_id)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Notification
# MAGIC We also want to send slack notification when the model changes from one stage to another:

# COMMAND ----------

# T03GXRB5N6A
# A03LPJ4U8RM-mlr-http-webhook
# C03H6RFMDFW
# curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Hello, World!"}' https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
# ml-in-production-webhooks

create_notification_webhook(model_name = "dbdemos_mlops_churn", slack_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T03GXRB5N6A/B056RJPFKBR/P4pwLyJwhGWpCYVOXyyGa9T")

# MAGIC ## Our Automated model validation is in place!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using MLFlow webhook, we'll trigger a slack notification and a validation job as soon as a Data Scientist request a model to be moved to Stating!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Next: let's see how a Data Scientist can [deploy the Auto ML model to registry and request to move it to STAGING]($./04_from_notebook_to_registry)
