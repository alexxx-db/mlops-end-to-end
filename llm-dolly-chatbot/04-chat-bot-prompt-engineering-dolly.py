# MAGIC ## Chat Bot Prompt engineering
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this example, we will improve our previous Q&A to create a chat bot.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The main thing we'll be adding is a memory between the different question so that our bot can answer having the context of the previous Q&A.

# MAGIC ### Keeping memory between multiple questions
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The main challenge for our chat bot is that we won't be able to use the entire discussion history as context to send to dolly. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC First of all this is expensive, but more importantly this won't support long discussion as we'll endup with a text longer than our max window size for our mdoel.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The trick is to use a summarize model and add an intermediate step which will take the summary of our discussion and inject it in our prompt.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will use an intermediate summarization task to do that, using `ConversationSummaryMemory` from `langchain`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note: This is a more advanced content, we recommend you start with the Previous notebook: 03-Q&A-prompt-engineering-for-dolly**

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Cluster Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Run this on a cluster with Databricks Runtime 13.0 ML GPU. It should work on 12.2 ML GPU as well.
# MAGIC - To run this notebook's examples _without_ distributed Spark inference at the end, all that is needed is a single-node 'cluster' with a GPU
# MAGIC   - A10 and V100 instances should work, and this example is designed to fit the model in their working memory at some cost to quality
# MAGIC   - A100 instances work best, and perform better with minor modifications commented below
# MAGIC - To run the examples using distributed Spark inference at the end, provision a cluster of GPUs (and change the repartitioning at the end to match GPU count)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Note that `bitsandbytes` is not needed if running on A100s and the code is modified per comments below to not load in 8-bit.*

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install -U transformers langchain chromadb accelerate bitsandbytes

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ./_resources/00-init $catalog=hive_metastore $db=dbdemos_llm

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Create our vector database connection for context

  langchain_model = build_qa_chain()

  with mlflow.start_run() as run:

      # See https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#custom-python-models for an example
      # The vector database lives outside of your model
      mlflow.langchain.log_model(langchain_model, artifact_path="model")
      model_registered = mlflow.register_model(f"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/model", "gardening-bot")

  # Move the model in production
  client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
  print("registering model version "+model_registered.version+" as production model")

  # Load the langchain pipeline & run inferences
  chain = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)
  chain.predict({"input_documents": similar_docs, "human_input": question})

# COMMAND ----------

# Make sure you restart the python kernel to free our gpu memory if you're using multiple notebooks0

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we've seen a basic prompt engineering solution using history memory. More advanced solution can be build to provide better context.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Having a good training dataset is key to improve our model performance and load better context. Collecting and preparing high quality data is likely the most important part to a successful bot!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A good way to improve your dataset is to capture your user questions and chat, and incrementally improve your Q&A dataset.  <br/>
# MAGIC As example, `langchain` is especially build to work well with a chat bot trained with a dataset similar to OpenAI's, which isn't exactly matching Dolly's. The closest your prompt is engineered to match your training dataset content, the better your bot will behave.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *A note on inference speed: As we load big models, inference time can be greatly optimized compiling our transformer models. Here is a quick example using onnx:*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `%pip install -U transformers langchain chromadb accelerate bitsandbytes protobuf==3.19.0 optimum onnx onnxruntime-gpu`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `%sh optimum-cli export onnx --model databricks/dolly-v2-7b  --device cuda --optimize O4 dolly_v2_7b_onnx`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForCausalLM
# MAGIC
# MAGIC # Use Dolly as main model
# MAGIC model_name = "databricks/dolly-v2-3b" # can use dolly-v2-3b, dolly-v2-7b or dolly-v2-12b for smaller model and faster inferences.
# MAGIC tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, padding_side="left")
# MAGIC model = ORTModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("databricks/dolly-v2-3b", export=True, provider="CUDAExecutionProvider")
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC *You could also leverage FasterTransformer. Contact your Databricks team for more details*
