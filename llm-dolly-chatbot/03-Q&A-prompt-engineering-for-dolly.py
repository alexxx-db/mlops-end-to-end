# MAGIC ## Prompt engineering
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Prompt engineering is a technique used to wrap the given user question with more information to better guide the model in its anwser.<br/>
# MAGIC A prompt engineered would typically contains:
# MAGIC - guidance on how to answer given the usage (*ex: You are a gardener. Answer the following question as best as you can to keep plants alive*)
# MAGIC - Extra context to help your model. For example similar text close to the user question (*ex: Knowing that [Content from your internal Q&A], please answer...*)
# MAGIC - Specific instruction in the answer (*ex: Answer in Italian*) 
# MAGIC - Information on the previous questions to keep a context if you're building a chat bot (compressed as embedding)
# MAGIC - ...

# MAGIC In this example, we'll use `langchain` to help us craft better prompt
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Our Gardening prompt engineering
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This example shows how to apply `langchain`, Hugging Face `transformers`, and even Apache Spark to answer questions about a specific text corpus. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It uses the Dolly2 LLM from Databricks, though this example can make use of any text-generation LLM or even OpenAI with minor changes.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Cluster Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Run this on a cluster with Databricks Runtime 13.0 ML GPU. It should work on 12.2 ML GPU as well.
# MAGIC - To run this notebook's examples _without_ distributed Spark inference at the end, all that is needed is a single-node 'cluster' with a GPU
# MAGIC   - A10 and V100 instances should work, and this example is designed to fit the model in their working memory at some cost to quality
# MAGIC   - A100 instances work best, and perform better with minor modifications commented below
# MAGIC - To run the examples using distributed Spark inference at the end, provision a cluster of GPUs (and change the repartitioning at the end to match GPU count)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Note that `bitsandbytes` is not needed if running on A100s and the code is modified per comments below to not load in 8-bit.*

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### 1/ Download our 2 embeddings model from hugging face (same as data preparation)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### 2/ Similarity search using chroma
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's test our similarity search with a simple question.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note that `k` (`similar_doc_count`): is the number of chunks of text retrieved to send to the prompt. Longer prompts add more context but takes longer to process.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that there are _many_ factors that affect how the language model answers a question. Most notable is the prompt template itself. This can be changed, and different prompts may work better or worse with certain models.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The generation process itself also has many knobs to tune, and often it simply requires trial and error to find settings that work best for certain models and certain data sets. See this [excellent guide from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The settings that most affect performance are:
# MAGIC - `max_new_tokens`: longer responses take longer to generate. Reduce for shorter, faster responses
# MAGIC - `num_beams`: if using beam search, more beams increase run time more or less linearly
